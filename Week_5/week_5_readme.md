## Project Timeline  

### **Week 5: Univariate Analysis & Initial Setup**  
- Summarize distributions of key variables using summary statistics.  
- Visualize variables with histograms, box plots, and density plots.  
- Identify missing data patterns and document potential causes.  
- Set up a Google Colab notebook for collaborative analysis.  

### **Week 6: Bivariate Analysis & Missing Data Handling**  
- Compute pairwise correlations for numerical variables.  
- Create scatter plots, correlation matrices, and cross-tabulations.  
- Analyze relationships between categorical variables using statistical tests (e.g., Chi-square test).  
- Implement initial missing data handling (imputation, deletion, or other methods).  

### **Week 7: Multivariate Analysis & Dimensionality Reduction**  
- Perform multiple regression analysis to explore complex relationships.  
- Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA if needed.  
- Continue addressing any unresolved missing data issues.  
- Document findings and update Colab notebook.  

### **Week 8: Clustering & Pattern Identification**  
- Conduct clustering analysis (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) if applicable.  
- Identify and interpret key clusters or patterns in the dataset.  
- Document preliminary insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Draft an initial summary report of findings.  

### **Week 9: Validating Findings & Finalizing Data Preparation**  
- Share exploratory findings with stakeholders and collect feedback.  
- Refine the data processing pipeline based on feedback.  
- Finalize dataset preparation (scaling, transformations, encoding).  
- Perform a final quality check before moving to modeling.  

### **Week 10: Summarizing EDA & Transitioning to Modeling**  
- Compile summary statistics and key insights from EDA.  
- Document any data quality improvements and transformations made.  
- Write a short report summarizing exploratory findings.  
- Develop an initial plan for predictive modeling.  

### **Week 11: Defining Hypotheses & Model Selection**  
- Clearly define hypotheses and modeling objectives.  
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.  
- Select initial modeling techniques (e.g., regression, classification, clustering).  
- Implement simple baseline models for benchmarking.  

### **Week 12: Model Building & Initial Evaluation**  
- Train initial models and record baseline performance metrics.  
- Evaluate models using accuracy, RMSE, F1-score, or other relevant metrics.  
- Tune hyperparameters and optimize model design.  
- Perform feature selection and engineering.  

### **Week 13: Hypothesis Testing & Model Refinement**  
- Conduct hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests) to validate assumptions.  
- Assess model assumptions (e.g., normality, collinearity, homoscedasticity).  
- Compare multiple models and select the best-performing one.  
- Prepare an interim summary of results.  

### **Week 14: Final Model Analysis & Interpretation**  
- Analyze model outputs and extract key insights.  
- Compare model findings with initial hypotheses and project goals.  
- Document results in a structured format.  
- Start drafting the final modeling report.  

### **Week 15: Visualization & Report Drafting**  
- Create visualizations for key insights (e.g., cost trends, geographical disparities).  
- Develop a dashboard or interactive visual report if applicable.  
- Outline the final presentation structure.  
- Draft the introduction and methodology sections of the report.  

### **Week 16: Refining Visualizations & Report Writing**  
- Get feedback on initial visualizations and refine them.  
- Write the in-depth analysis and results sections of the report.  
- Begin preparing PowerPoint slides for the final presentation.  
- Proofread and revise report content for clarity and coherence.  

### **Finalizing Report & Presentation**  
- Complete all visualizations and integrate them into the report.  
- Finalize the discussion and conclusion sections.  
- Rehearse the presentation and collect feedback.  
- Make necessary revisions based on feedback.  

### **Editing, Proofreading, & Final Touches**  
- Proofread the final report for errors and consistency.  
- Make last-minute refinements and updates.  
- Finalize presentation slides and speaker notes.  
- Double-check submission requirements and deadlines.  

### **Practice & Q&A Preparation**  
- Conduct a dry run of the final presentation.  
- Address final concerns and refine slides.  
- Prepare responses for anticipated Q&A questions.  
- Confirm logistics for the final presentation.  

### **Presentation & Retrospective**  
- Deliver the final presentation to stakeholders.  
- Submit the final report and all supporting materials.  
- Conduct a project retrospective to reflect on key takeaways.  
- Document lessons learned for future projects.
